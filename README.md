# 3D-Prints

## Introduction

The MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application is designed to facilitate shopping for 3D prints while offering users the capability to upload custom 3D models and obtain estimates for their printing costs. Here's an expanded overview of the application's features and functionality:

User Authentication:

Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the application's features.
Allow users to sign up, log in, log out, and reset their passwords if necessary.
Product Catalog:

Display a catalog of 3D prints available for purchase, organized into categories and subcategories for easy navigation.
Provide detailed product descriptions, images, and pricing information for each item in the catalog.
Shopping Cart:

Enable users to add items to their shopping carts and adjust quantities as needed.
Implement functionality for users to remove items from their carts and proceed to checkout when ready.
Custom 3D Model Upload:

Allow users to upload their custom 3D models directly through the web application.
Support various file formats commonly used for 3D models, such as STL, OBJ, and FBX.
Estimation of Printing Costs:

Upon uploading a custom 3D model, provide users with an estimated cost for printing based on factors such as material, size, complexity, and printing method (e.g., FDM, SLA).
Display the estimated cost to users along with the uploaded model, allowing them to make informed decisions before proceeding with the printing order.
Order Management:

Enable users to review their order history, including past purchases and uploaded 3D models awaiting printing.
Implement order tracking functionality to keep users informed about the status of their orders, from processing to delivery.
Payment Integration:

Integrate a secure payment gateway to allow users to complete their purchases online.
Support various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, and other popular payment options.
User Profiles:

Provide users with personalized profiles where they can manage their account information, shipping addresses, and payment methods.
Allow users to update their profiles, change passwords, and review past orders.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that the web application is responsive and optimized for a seamless user experience across devices of all screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Admin Panel:

Create an admin panel with features for managing products, categories, orders, and user accounts.
Allow administrators to add new products, update existing ones, and monitor sales and inventory levels.
